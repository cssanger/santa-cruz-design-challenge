This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting started
### Install dependencies
- First, you'll need NodeJS (which will come with npm). Download it from https://nodejs.org/en/
- From in the santa-cruz-design-challenge directory, run `npm install`
- Start the app with `npm start`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Design challenge
1. See the list of build kit options at the bottom? It's sure ugly. Can you make it more customer friendly to look at?
2. How will the current layout look on a mobile device? C an you adjust the layout so that it looks nice across screen sizes?
